1.  var - It's function-scoped and can be re-declared.
    let - It is block-scoped. It is the standard way for values that will change.
    const - It is block-scoped. It is used for values that won't change.

2. It takes an array or an object and spreads its contents out.
    example: const user = { name: "Abir", age: 25 };
             const details = { ...user, city: "Dhaka" }; 
             Result: { name: "Abir", age: 25, city: "Dhaka" }

3. foreach - Just loops through each item (like a basic for loop). 
    map - Loops through each item and returns a new array based on the function you provide.
    filter - Loops through each item and returns a new array with only the items that match a condition.

4. A shorter, "cooler" way to write functions.
    example:
    // Regular function
    function add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    // Arrow function
    const add = (a, b) => a + b;

5. Instead of using single quotes ' or double quotes ", we use backticks. 
    This allows us to easily include variables and expressions inside strings using ${}.
    example:
    const name = "Abir";
    const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
    Result: "Hello, Abir!"
